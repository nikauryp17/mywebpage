<h1>Nikaury Peralta's Gallery</h1>

    <p>Here in sharing my raster images...I chose this pictures because they represent part of me, hoobies, lifestyle and my every day basis. I combined 6 pictures plus one as the background using the software Canva.  

The more difficult part of the project was choosing the pictures. I solved it by going through my pictures having in mind what i like to do, what im currently doing and my goals. </p>

<p>This is my vector image...I chose these colors because they represent me, who i am and somehow what i like. My source of inspiration was honeslty an app called snapchat, which has an avatar as the profile image. The most challenging part of the project was how to start it off. </p>

 <P>The next audio was my audio assignment...
    I decided to record the nature because its one of the things a like and represent me the most. 
 I combien one single audio of almost one minute in total, you can hear the water, the wind, birds... and peaceful magic of the nature just in general. </P>
