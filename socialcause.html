    <h1>Financial education</h1>
    <h2>By Nikaury Peralta </h2>
    <p>I am a finance student and I wanted to bring up a social matter which is financial education.
    The lack of financial education affects every indivual in a very particular way, specailly when we dont know how simple things like tudent and/or bank loans, credit cards, savings, credit score, taxes and so much more influence our every day basis and life just in general.</p>

      <p>This video should help each and all of us be more aware of how much knowlegde we are missing regarding finance and how learning about it can open our eyes to a bunch of thigs that neither school nor our parents teach us.</p>
